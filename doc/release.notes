!=================== AmpGen v2r0 2020-25-04 ==================
 - Refactored caching logic away from being computations being stored with event data.
 - Support for AVX2 for amplitude evaluation / integration single/double precision.
 - Updated plotting for making component amplitude plots.

!=================== AmpGen v1r2 2019-11-12 ==================
 - New phase space Generator TreePhaseSpace for producing narrow resonances. 
 - Improved handling of CP conjugated amplitudes.
 - Add vertices f_fS_S{L,R} f_Vf_S{L,R} for couplings with well-defined chirality. 
 - Add initial states with ill-defined flavour to PolarisedSum
!=================== AmpGen v1r2 2019-08-13 ==================
 - Tagged to match results in Gauss/LbAmpGen v49r14+ 
 - Improved thread support for CoherentSum
 - Add examples/QcGenerator for Î¨(3770) decays 
 - Updated ExpressionParser with improved stability.
 - Removed unused / untested lineshapes AxialKaon and ObelixRho 
!=================== AmpGen v1r1 2019-03-22 ==================
 - Added support for fitting more general final states, i.e. with multiple fermions, photons etc.
 - Added example fitter with generic polarisation (see examples/FitterWithPolarisation.cpp).
 - Added published LHCb models of D->K3pi and D->KKpipi to options.
!=================== AmpGen v1r0 2018-07-25 ==================
 - Units switched to GeV, will break existing options. 
 - Changed parser to use input files rather than streams, i.e. usage becomes Fitter options_file.opt rather than Fitter < options_file.opt.
 - Support for command line arguments, for example: Generator example_file.opt --Seed=12 --nEvents 100000.
 - Support for multithreaded compilation of different components of the amplitude.
 - Added support for helper strings in NamedParameters, printed if the global flag --help is used. 
 - General cleanup and consolidation of class structure.
